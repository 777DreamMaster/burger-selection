<h2>High-Level Overview</h2>

<h4>Using a neural network for quick customer service</h4>
Using input data, obtained from the analysis of the appearance of people from another neural network, to predict client preferences.

<h4>Why we use a neural network in this case?</h4>
The use of an artificial intelligence allows you to constantly update the customer selection database to select the optimal solution, which is almost impossible to do with a huge amount of "if" in real time.

<h2>Details</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Processing received data, further training on it </li>
  <li> Using Weka library for java </li>
  <li> Using a cashier or electronic terminal as a “trainer” (in the real case) </li>
</ul>

<h4>A Short Example Using AI</h4>
