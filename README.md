<h2>High-Level Overview</h2>
<h4>Using a neural network for quick customer service.</h4>
<p>Using input data, obtained from the analysis of the appearance of people from another neural network, to predict client preferences.</p>
<h4>Why we use a neural network in this case?</h4>
<p>The use of an artificial intelligence allows you to constantly update the customer selection database to select the optimal solution, which is almost impossible to do with a huge amount of "if" in real time.</p>
<h2>Details</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Processing received data, further training on it</li>
  <li>Using "Fast Artificial Neural Network" Library (FANN), "Fannj" and "Java Native Access"</li>
  <li>Using a cashier or electronic terminal as a “trainer” (in the real case)</li>
</ul> 
<h4>A Short Example Using AI<h4>
<h5>Input</h5>
<code>1 2 0 ... etc and so on</code>
